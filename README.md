(When a model becomes sufficiently good at mirroring observable reality, it becomes natural to ask if it could be considered as if it were an aspect of reality, not just an approximation. A sense that models are substantial motivated the discovery of
previously unsuspected phenomena, such as antimatter, which was predicted because
of the available solutions to an equation. We are extending Wigner’s trust given to
the ”unreasonable” success of theory. If neural networks can predict or rediscover
the theories we know about, might nature not be as similar to the neural networks as
to the theories?)
